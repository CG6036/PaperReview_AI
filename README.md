# Paper Review AI using Large Language Models

We have developed a Paper Review AI using conference acceptance results from OpenReview.net. By integrating large language models, our system estimates scores for various criteria and predicts the acceptance probability of a paper. In addition, the AI bot generates detailed reviews by highlighting each paperâ€™s strengths and weaknesses.

*This project was developed as part of a class project by Jiwoo Song, Jeong Jin Park, and Soonwoo Cha from Seoul National University.*
